# encryption-and-decryption
The primary objective was to develop a simple Python program that enables users to:  • Input a message  • Encrypt it securely using AES  • Decrypt it to retrieve the original message  The implementation demonstrates how encryption works with block ciphers using Python's  pycryptodome library.
